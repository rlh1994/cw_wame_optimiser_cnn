# Machine Learning Coursework
The purpose of this work, set as a piece of coursework,  was to implement the WAME optimiser [1] and use it to train a CNN on a dataset of our choosing. We implemented the optimiser in Tensorflow 2.0 and built a model to predict the classes in the EMNIST [2] dataset. Overall we achieve a 94.6% accuracy, increasing to 99.1% for top-2 accuracy.
